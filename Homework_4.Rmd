### Question 1

```{r q1}
# assign values to variables per instructions
x <- 1.1
a <- 2.2
b <- 3.3

# assign the subsequent expressions to variable z
# part a.
z <- x^(a^b)
print(z)

# part b. 
z <- (x^a)^b
print(z)

# part c. 
z <- 3*x^3 + 2*x^2 + 1
print(z)
```

### Question 2

```{r q2}
# part a.  (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)
a <- c(seq(from=1, to=8, by=1), seq(from=7, to=1)) # concatenate sequence 1-8 w/ sequence 7-1 (descending)
print(a)  

# part b. (1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5)
# assign sequence 1-5 to variable b
b <- seq(from=1, to=5) # prepare reference sequence called variable b
# combine 5 different rep components as variable b2, each rep containing: variable b's indexed, corresponding element and the number of times repeated (increasing increment for each b element):
b2 <- c(rep(b[1], 1), rep(b[2], 2), rep(b[3], 3), rep(b[4], 4), rep(b[5], 5)) # subset positive index values
print(b2)

# part c. (5,4,4,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1)
    # note to use the variable b again, which represents a sequence from 1 to 5
# combine 5 different rep components as variable c, each rep containing: variable b's indexed element (corresponding from the 5th element to the 1st element) and the number of times repeated (increasing increment for each b element)
c <- c(rep(b[5], 1), rep(b[4], 2),  rep(b[3], 3), rep(b[2], 4), rep(b[1], 5))
print(c)

```

### Question 3

Note the following polar coordinate/calculus-derived equations: 

* r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

* theta = atan(y/x)

```{r q3}
# create a vector of two random uniform numbers
vec<-runif(2)
print(vec)

# In a spatial map, these can be interpreted as x and y coordinates that give the location of an individual 
# Using one of Râ€™s inverse trigonometry functions (asin(), acos(), or atan()), convert these numbers into polar coordinates 

# subset 1st and 2nd element from the vector within calculations...
r <- sqrt(vec[1]^2 + vec[2]^2) 
theta <- atan(vec[2]/vec[1]) 

# combine newly calculated polar coordinates into variable polar_coord and print
polar_coord <- c(r,theta) 
print(polar_coord)

```
### Question 4

```{r q4}
# Set up Noah's Ark queue
queue <- c("sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant") # sheep=first in line (for now...)

# a.	the serpent arrives;
queue <- c(queue, "serpent") # serpent concatenated after existing queue
print(queue)

# b.	the sheep enters the ark;
ark <- "sheep"
queue <- queue[-1] # sheep is out of queue now
print(queue)

# c.	the donkey arrives and talks his way to the front of the line;
queue <- c("donkey", queue) # donkey concatenated before existing queue
print(queue)

# d.	the serpent gets impatient and leaves;
queue <- queue[-5]
print(queue)

# e.	the owl gets bored and leaves;
queue <- queue[-3]
print(queue)

# f.	the aphid arrives and the ant invites him to cut in line.
queue <- c(queue[1:2], "aphid", queue[3])
print(queue)

# g.	Finally, determine the position of the aphid in the line.
which(queue == "aphid")
# The aphid is third in line!

```
### Question 5

```{r q5}
# create a vector of all of the integers from 1 to 100 
vec1 <- seq(from=1, to=100)

# subset for values in vec1 that are *not* (!=) divisible by 2, 3, or 7 (thus !=0)
vec2 <- which(vec1[]%%2 !=0 & vec1[]%%3 !=0 & vec1[]%%7 != 0) 
print(vec2)
```
