--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Make sure everything is set up and working on the laptop that you will be using for this course (most current versions of R and RStudio, tinytex package, Typora (a markdown editor), Notepad++, GitHub account)

2.	Learn markdown in Typora.

3.	Create a typora document to illustrate the following formatting:

•	headers (levels 1-6)

•	unordered lists

•	ordered lists

•	manual line breaks

•	links

•	images

•	block quotes

•	plain code blocks

•	R code blocks

•	in line block

•	in line LaTeX equation

•	centered LaTeX equation

•	horizontal rule

•	simple table


# Headers



# Header

## header

### header

#### header

##### header

###### header



# Unordered list

* unordered lists
* underordered lists
  * subset unordered list



# Manual line break



###### ^that was a manual line break

# Links

# Block quotes

> In this first paragraph, it should be noted that Blockquote is a 10 letter word. 
>
> >I did another sideways carat for fun. I wonder if you can make a rainbow? 
>
> This is another, second paragraph just for the heck of it. 



> I separated out the blockquote just now, using the enter button multiple times to exit from each block quote.

# Code blocks...

### (Fenced) Code Blocks == Plain code blocks

```

```



``````

``````



``````
I just made a blank box (similar to a text box)--need 6 back ticks ` or you can use tildas ~
``````

### Code span // non "pre-formatted code block"? == In line blocks

`printf()`

`maybe?`

`insert text between backtick quotes`

```function test() {console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");}```



### R code block

```{r, echo=TRUE}

```
```R

```

** this is coded for R* language specifically


# LaTeX equation fun

### In line LaTeX equation

$z_{n+1}= z*n^2 + c$

### Centered LaTeX equation

$$
z_{n+1}= z*n^2 + c
$$



# Horizontal rule

# Simple table

| First header                       | Second Header |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| this is one sleek looking table :) |               |


# Diagrams! 

** This section requires Typora markdown, such as via Mermaid *

We ran through some examples together in class

```{mermaid, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
graph TD
	A[Start] --> B[Stop]
	
# Running any iteration of this flowchart sequence returns the message: "'mermaid' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."
  
# Further search on the web seems to indicate that Typora (not R Markdown) is ideal for using Mermaid and other flowchart sequence Markdown editing.

# Further exploration of R Markdown would be helpful for manually creating these figures.
```

```{mermaid, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
graph LR
	A(Start) ==> B[Stop] 
	
# Running any iteration of this flowchart sequence returns the message: "'mermaid' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."
  
# Further search on the web seems to indicate that Typora (not R Markdown) is ideal for using Mermaid and other flowchart sequence Markdown editing.

## 4 - 9.
- create simple cause-and-effect diagram to illustrate one or two hypotheses from your research. Circles represent variables or measurements. Arrows (which can be labelled) indicate cause and effect directions.

- import the image into your Typora document.

- convert your hand-drawn flowchart into one of these display items and imbed it in your Typora document.

- explore themes and save results

Ok, now my attempt:

- Before:

- After: 

```{mermaid, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
graph TB
	A(1426 patients ptt from medical record)--> |exclusions| b(185 ptt excluded due to incomplete monitor procedure and medical record) --> c(3 ptt excluded due to never being assessed)
	
	A --> |cleaned dataset| D(1238 ptt were included in analysis for risk factor of smoking on BMI)
	D --> |smoking| E(higher BMI)
  D --> |no smoking| F(average BMI range)

# Further search on the web seems to indicate that Typora (not R Markdown) is ideal for using Mermaid and other flowchart sequence Markdown editing. 

# Further exploration of R Markdown would be helpful for manually creating these figures.
