### Question 1
```
Find:\s{2,}
Replace:,

##Elements find 2 or more consecutive spaces and replace with a comma. 

```

### Question 2
```
Find:(\w+), (\w+), (.*)
Replace:\2 \1 \(\3\)

##Elements find one or more consecutive word characters (with capture) for two discrete captures--separated by commas--and then captures "all the rest" as one discrete capture. We then replace elements in the new order, capture 2, capture 1, and then capture 3 (where capture 3 includes '\' backslashes to recognize and add the denoted parentheses.

```

### Question 3
```
Find:(mp3)\s
Replace:\1\r

##Elements find 'mp3' characters followed by a space and replace it with 'mp3' and a line break (This moves the following information on another line). 

```

### Question 4
```
Find:(\d+) (.+)(.mp3)
Replace:\2_\1\3

##Elements find and capture the following entities: (1) one or more consecutive single number characters [0-9], (2) any character until the next capture, and (3) the text,'.mp3' These components are replaced and reordered in the following order: capture 2, an underscore, capture 1, and capture 3. (The purpose of the exercise was to extract the four digit number and put it at the end of the song title.) 

```

### Question 5
```
Find:(\w)\w+,(\w+),\d+.\d,(\d+)
Replace:\1_\2,\3

##Elements find and capture the first letter of the word, the second word, and the second numeric variable (the first numeric variable is, by default, excluded). These three captures are placed in order with capture 1 and capture 2 linked by an underscore while capture 3 is separated from the rest by a comma. 

```

### Question 6
```
Find:(\w)\w+,(\w{4})\w+,\d+.\d,(\d+)
Replace:\1_\2,\3

##Elements find and capture the first letter of the word, the first four letters of the second word, and the second numeric variable (the first numeric variable is, by default, excluded). These three captures are placed in order with capture 1 and capture 2 linked by an underscore while capture 3 is separated from the rest by a comma. 

```

### Question 7
```
Find:^(\w{3})\w+,(\w{3})\w+,(\d+.\d),(\d+)
Replace:\1\2, \4, \3
